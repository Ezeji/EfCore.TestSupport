## Documentation

The NuGet package [EfCore.TestSupport](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EfCore.TestSupport/) containing methods to help you unit test applications that use
[Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/index) for database access. This readme defines the various groups, with links to the documentation in the 
[EfCore.TestSupport wiki](https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCore.TestSupport/wiki).

*NOTE: The techniques are explained in much more details in chapter 17 of the book [Entity Framework in Action, second edition](https://bit.ly/EfCoreBookEd2).*

Here is an image covering just a few of the methods, in **bold** available in this library.

The various groups of tools are:

1. Helpers to create an in-memory Sqlite database for unit testing.  
See [Sqlite in memory test database](https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCore.TestSupport/wiki/1.-Sqlite-in-memory-test-database).
2. Helpers to create an InMemory database for unit testing.  
See [EF InMemory test database](https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCore.TestSupport/wiki/2.-EF-InMemory-test-database).
3. Helpers to create connection strings with a unique database name.  
See [Creating connection strings](https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCore.TestSupport/wiki/3.-Creating-connection-strings).
4. Helpers for creating unique SQL Server databases for unit testing.  
See [Create SQL Server databases](https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCore.TestSupport/wiki/4.-Create-SQL-Server-databases).
6. Helpers to create Cosmos DB databases linked to Azure Cosmos DB Emulator.

6. Helpers for creating an empty database, and deleting SQL unit test databases.  
See [Quickly create empty databases](https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCore.TestSupport/wiki/5.-Quickly-create-empty-database).
7. Various tools for getting test data, or file paths to test data.   
See [Test Data tools](https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCore.TestSupport/wiki/6.-Test-Data-tools).
8. A tool for applying a SQL script file to a EF Core database.  
See [Run SQL Script](https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCore.TestSupport/wiki/7.-Run-SQL-Script).
9. Tools for capturing EF Core logging.
